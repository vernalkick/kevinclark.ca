L'Étang des Moulins hosts many shows through ought the year, offers cooking classes and it the perfect place to go with a group. The website is an essential tool to make all of this possible.

They can add dates to the calendar and inform people of upcoming events, showcase the great menu and allow people to reserve directly online. We wanted to make it as accessible as possible, so using responsive web design was a no-brainer.

The result was everything we had hoped for in the kickoff meeting: simple, elegant, fast and accessible. It gets out of the way so that they can focus on what’s truly important, cooking great food.
