I joined the Shopify roughly around the same time that the Montreal office opened. Our mission: providing the best experience possible for our merchant's customers. We want to make our merchants look great and give them the tools to compete with giants like Amazon without having to spend a fortune or have a staff working full time to keep the site up and running. As a designer, this was an incredible chance to work on things that would impact not only the 200,000 merchants on our platform but also the millions of customers[^1] that they have. Another benefit of improving things for the end customer is that it's good for merchants. They provide a better experience to their customers, their customers are happier, the merchants make more sales.[^2]

At the time, Shopify was a much smaller company, so we could only focus on a small number of things at the same time and that meant that some areas hadn't been updated in a long time. That was unfortunately the case for our checkout page. Aside from the minor improvements and A/B tests here and there, the checkout flow had stayed the same for many years. And, as we know in the tech industry, nothing lasts forever. While our checkout was great for the time it was designed for originally, the world had changed.
