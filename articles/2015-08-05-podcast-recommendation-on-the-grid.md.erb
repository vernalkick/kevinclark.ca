I'm a huge podcast listener. Usually, when I say that, people ask me to recommend some design podcasts to listen to. I usually don't have a good answer. To be quite honest, most design podcasts out there are a bit boring to me. Except for this one. On the Grid is a podcast where the hosts think out loud about different questions around design. It has the perfect mix of serious conversations about a particular topic, and the more fun random conversations about anything. Really recommend it.
