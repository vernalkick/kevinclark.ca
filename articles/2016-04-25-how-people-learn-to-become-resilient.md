Maria Konnikova in [her article in The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/the-secret-formula-for-resilience):

> Frame adversity as a challenge, and you become more flexible and able to deal with it, move on, learn from it, and grow. Focus on it, frame it as a threat, and a potentially traumatic event becomes an enduring problem; you become more inflexible, and more likely to be negatively affected.
