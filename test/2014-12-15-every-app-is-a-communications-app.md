Messaging as a primary way of interaction is strange trend for us in North America, because it didn't become a thing here until very recently. What's great about messaging is that everyone just gets it. Because of that, it's a pattern that can make a lot of sense for many types of apps.

Ron Palmeri, CEO of Layer [recently shared a few ideas](http://blog.layer.com/every-app-is-a-communications-app/) on how some apps would be way better with the integration of messaging:

> This app is essentially a marketplace for babysitters and parents in need of a babysitter. The app pre-qualifies babysitters through background checks and then presents parents with a list of available babysitters, based on the date, time and experience criteria the parent sets.
>
> Transformation opportunities:
>
> - Messaging to connect parents to each other to collaborate and discuss the selection and ultimate hiring of a babysitter.
> - During-job photo or video messaging from babysitter/kids to parents to keep parents updated on the kidsâ€™ well being.
> - Sharing of checklists and other content types so parents and babysitter can stay in sync during the job.
