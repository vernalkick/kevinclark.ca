This week was very special. While in San Francisco, Rafa and I not only met in person for the first time, but we also got to record an episode of Design Details with our friends Bryn and Brian. I really admire what they've been able to do with Spec, so it was a real honor to be a guest on their show. In this episode we talk about podcasting, side projects, building design systems, design obsession, and so much more.
