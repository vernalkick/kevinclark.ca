Adam Morse on accessibility:

> When I sit down to design things I try to put on the veil of ignorance. I imagine a world where I am not who I am right now. And I think about all the things that could possibly frustrate me. Then I think some more. 

> I try to design for that reality. I don't design for myself and my perfect eyesight, my retina screens, and my fast internet connection.
