Sep Kamvar offers a [very intelligent argument against user-centered design in this article](http://farmerandfarmer.org/mastery/builder.html):

> The danger in user-centered design is that it releases the designer of the responsibility for having a vision for the world. Why have one when we can just ask users what they want? But this is a very limiting mindset. The user sees the world as it is. Our job as builders is to create the world as it could be.

Iâ€™m still undecided about where I fall on this spectrum. I do see the benefits of both approaches. But maybe user-centered design isn't about asking what the user wants, but instead looking at the *problems* the user face and then use your powers to bridge the gap between your vision and reality through design. I am, once again, reminded of this Henry Ford quote:

> If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.

I can't help but think that while Ford knew his customers were wrong about their self-proclaimed desires, he understood their fundamental need for a better, faster way of transportation. And that's the an important part of user-centered design.

History has seen many great ideas fail because they were introduced at the wrong time or were designed in a vacuum. Combining user-centered design to a strong vision of the future might just be a good way to guard against that.
