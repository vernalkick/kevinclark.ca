Medium recently updated its policy to prohibit public shaming amongst other things (emphasis mine):

> We want everyone to feel at home on Medium. This doesn’t mean you’re free from having your views challenged or your ideas re-characterized. Surprising or controversial views prompt exactly the kind of impassioned engagement we want here. **But some speech shuts down more expression than it opens up, by causing silence, retreat, isolation, or intimidation**. No one should feel any less than who they are from spending time here. And that’s where we decided to draw the line.

Bingo.
