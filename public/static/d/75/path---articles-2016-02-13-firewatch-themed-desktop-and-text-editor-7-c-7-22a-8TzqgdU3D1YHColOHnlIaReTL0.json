I have 2 games on my iPhone: <a href=\"http://www.monumentvalleygame.com\">Monument Valley</a> and <a href=\"http://altosadventure.com\">Alto’s Adventure</a>.

When I heard they were joining forces with Campo Santo to create their first game, it caught my attention. Well, as you probably know, the game came out this week and it’s fantastic. It’s not a game in the traditional sense of the term. It’s much more like a movie that you get to interact with. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything.</p>\n<p>Because I loved the game so much, I decided to give my computer a Firewatch look.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure--flush\">\n  <img src=\"http://d.pr/i/ccoh/60ES192P+\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>Here&apos;s the final product in all its glory. <a href=\"http://d.pr/i/ccoh/60ES192P+\" class=\"external-link\">View full size</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Here’s how you can recreate it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.camposanto.com/post/138965082204/firewatch-launch-wallpaper-when-we-redid-the\">Download the official Firewatch wallpaper</a>, available on the Campo Santo website.
