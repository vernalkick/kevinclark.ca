They’re super talented, so I’m very confident that they won’t have trouble finding another job.

It’s only going to become harder and harder for design agencies to stay independent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don’t know everything. It’s easy to judge without knowing all the facts. Running a company is extremely difficult.
