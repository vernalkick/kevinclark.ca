If you’re like me and you’re a huge fan of lettering and sketchnoting, this book is for you. We tend to take Sharpies for granted, but they’re an amazing tool that lets you express your creativity in many different ways. I love everything about this book. It’s the perfect size and makes sure to inspire you with every page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sharpie-Art-Workshop-Techniques-Transforming/dp/1631590480\">You can buy it now on Amazon</a></p>","frontmatter":{"pretitle":null,"title":"Sharpie Art Workshop","date":"02.08.15"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/articles/2015-08-02-sharpie-art-workshop/"}}
