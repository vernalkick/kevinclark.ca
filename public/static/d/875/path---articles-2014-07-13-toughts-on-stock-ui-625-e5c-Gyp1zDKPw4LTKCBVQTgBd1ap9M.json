Stock UI is never going to replace the need for solid content hierarchy, great user experience and good product design<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>. The <em>look</em> of an app is the easy part.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So don’t be fooled by the fact that the default iOS 7 UI elements look fresh <em>today</em> — it won’t last forever and only addresses the superficial part of design. I still recommend developers try their hands at designing if they don’t have the ressources to hire a full-blown designer, I know lots of developers who are also excellent product designers.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Default controls were acceptable in the first year or so of the App Store, but people got bored of it eventually. I assume the same thing will be true for the iOS 7 look in a few years.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>So many buzzwords.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"pretitle":null,"title":"Toughts on Stock UI","date":"13.07.14"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/articles/2014-07-13-toughts-on-stock-ui/"}}
