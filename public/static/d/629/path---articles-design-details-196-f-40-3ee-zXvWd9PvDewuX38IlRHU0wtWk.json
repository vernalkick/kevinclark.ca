{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><img src=\"./design-details.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This week was very special. While in San Francisco, Rafa and I not only met in person for the first time, but we also got to record an episode of Design Details with our friends Bryn and Brian. I really admire what theyâ€™ve been able to do with Spec, so it was a real honor to be a guest on their show. In this episode we talk about podcasting, side projects, building design systems, design obsession, and so much more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/68532\">Give it a listen on Spec</a></p>","frontmatter":{"pretitle":"Appearance","title":"Design Details 196","date":"2017-05-03T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/articles/design-details-196/"}}
