At Shopify we always consider the full buying experience. From the store to the checkout to the post purchase experience. For this project, we wanted to help build trust between merchants and their customers by giving customers more insight about their order right from their website. So right after your purchase, you can see a map with the current location of your shipment and see the estimated deliver date of your package to plan accordingly. A nice benefit about exposing that information to the customer is that it reduces the number of emails and calls that the merchant receives about the status of their order. This way, merchants can spend more time focusing on their business and less time in email.
