I didn’t win unfortunately, but Paul Pritchard wrote <a href=\"http://shopifypartnerblog.myshopify.com/blogs/blog/15409119-what-does-design-mean-to-you-enter-shopify-dribbble-s-design-contest\">an excellent article</a> about the design process behind his winning shot. Well worth a read.</p>\n<p>There’s still time to <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/1650934-Design-is-Official-Shopify-Dribbble-Playoff/rebounds\">enter the playoff</a> (you could win really cool prizes). The contest ends Tuesday, August 5th. Can’t wait to see what design means to you.</p>","frontmatter":{"pretitle":null,"title":"Design is...","date":"30.07.14"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/articles/2014-07-30-design-is/"}}
