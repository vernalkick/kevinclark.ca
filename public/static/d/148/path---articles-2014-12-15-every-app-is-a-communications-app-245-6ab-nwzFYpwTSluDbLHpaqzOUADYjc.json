{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Messaging as a primary way of interaction is strange trend for us in North America, because it didn’t become a thing here until very recently. What’s great about messaging is that everyone just gets it. Because of that, it’s a pattern that can make a lot of sense for many types of apps.</p>\n<p>Ron Palmeri, CEO of Layer <a href=\"http://blog.layer.com/every-app-is-a-communications-app/\">recently shared a few ideas</a> on how some apps would be way better with the integration of messaging:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This app is essentially a marketplace for babysitters and parents in need of a babysitter. The app pre-qualifies babysitters through background checks and then presents parents with a list of available babysitters, based on the date, time and experience criteria the parent sets.</p>\n<p>Transformation opportunities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Messaging to connect parents to each other to collaborate and discuss the selection and ultimate hiring of a babysitter.</li>\n<li>During-job photo or video messaging from babysitter/kids to parents to keep parents updated on the kids’ well being.</li>\n<li>Sharing of checklists and other content types so parents and babysitter can stay in sync during the job.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"pretitle":null,"title":"Every App is a Communications App","date":"15.12.14"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/articles/2014-12-15-every-app-is-a-communications-app/"}}
