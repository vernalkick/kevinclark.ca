The keys are smaller than a full-size keyboard (there's no way around that), but I found that the adjustment time was minimal. I think that has a lot to do with the much smaller than normal keys they used for punctuation characters you don't use often. For example, the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \";\"), \", \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"'\"), \" and \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"[\"), \" keys are half the size of the other keys on the keyboard. That allows the rest of the keys to still be at a decent size for typing. There is, however, one thing about the keyboard layout that is pretty frustrating in daily use: the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"tab\"), \" button. In order to save space, they put tab and caps lock on the same key. That means that you have to hit \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Ctrl + Caps lock\"), \" in order to produce a tab. Why does that matter? Because tab is a very frequently used key. On my Mac I \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"cmd + tab\"), \" all the time, but with this keyboard it's inconvenient enough that I still find myself double pressing the home button instead. On top of that, if you're coding on the iPad (something I'm doing more and more) the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"tab\"), \" key is very important. In comparison, \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"caps lock\"), \" is something I use very rarely. I feel like they got that key backwards. In my opinion, \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"tab\"), \" should be the main action and \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"caps lock\"), \" should be the secondary action. Another idea would be to put the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"caps lock\"), \" function on the shift key. From a mental model perspective, this would make more sense since \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"shift\"), \" makes a single letter uppercase and \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"control + shift\"), \" would turn caps lock on.

That\\u2019s a nice idea in theory, but in my usage I found myself always using the iPad at the same angle, which was made more difficult by the fact that these little arms can move freely. You also need to be careful about adjusting the screen simply by pushing your iPad. I noticed that if the arms weren\\u2019t perfectly aligned with the sides of the iPad, it would press down on the screen and ripple the image, which didn\\u2019t seem like a good thing to do to your iPad. On top of that, the arms hold the iPad a bit too low compared to the keyboard, making it really hard to touch the bottom parts of the screen. I believe they had to do this in order to have the iPad sit flush with the case once closed, but I don\\u2019t think the tradeoff is worth it. A nice touch is that when you fold the iPad over the keyboard, the screen turn off automatically like it does with a Smart Cover.
