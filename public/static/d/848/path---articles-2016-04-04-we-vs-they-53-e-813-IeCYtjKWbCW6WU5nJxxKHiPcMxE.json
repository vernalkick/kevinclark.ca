{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I’ve been interviewing a lot these days at Shopify, so I’ve started to pick up on certain patterns I see when talking to people in interviews. One that I started noticing is how people talk about their past experiences.</p>\n<p>Some people will say: “They were doing marketing websites for various clients” and others will say: “We were doing marketing websites for various clients”. It’s a subtle difference, but to me it highlights the level of investment the person had into their work. Did they have a sense of ownership? Were they allowed to make decisions?</p>\n<p>In a way, saying “we” means you consider yourself part of the team. It means you were engaged in making decisions and that you had an important role that company or project.</p>\n<p>This is just a small example, but the <em>way</em> you say things can often tell people more about you that <em>what</em> you’re saying. Noticing these details will make you a better interviewer.</p>","frontmatter":{"pretitle":null,"title":"We vs They","date":"2016-04-04"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/articles/2016-04-04-we-vs-they/"}}
